building electricity blocks calculus of the universe (two classes)
	fermions (quarks & leptons) make up matter
		two cannot occupy the same quantum space (bosons can)
	bosonsÂ 
		gauge bosons
			force carrying
			"function as the 'glue' holding matter together"
			bose-einstein condensation
		higgs boson
		graviton (hypothetical)
		some composite particles (of fermions)
there are 4 rules which govern the subatomic particles
	strong nuclear
	weak nuclear
	electromagnetism
		all atomic bonds
	gravity
		matter attracts
corresponding particles
	strong: pions and gluons
	weak: w and z bosons
	gravity: photon graviton
	electromagnetism: photon
particle effects
	graviton attracts ??WHICH PARTICLES?? (gravity)
	gluon join quarks to form hadrons aka proton/neutron (strong)
	w/z bosons radioactive decay/fission (weak force)
	photons attract charged particles (electromagnetism)
	higgs boson gives particles mass
